# CardioVascularDiseasePrediction
A Machine Learning Project to determine whether  a person is prone to heart disease or not.

Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning | Python,Scikit-learn,Flask
-	Developed a website that predicts the probability of a person having heart diseases.
-	Used Random Forest Algorithm trained by Data set from Kaggle to predict probability
- Used Flask to connect the Machine Learning Model to the website.
- Aimed at reducing the hassle of checking patientâ€™s medical statistics in order to undergo various scans.
